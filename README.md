#  KeyObjective
The main goal of the Hangman game is to guess the hidden word before running out of allowed incorrect guesses. The challenge is to reveal the word while minimizing mistakes.
# Key Insights
Word Guessing Dynamics: Players guess letters to uncover a hidden word, with limited wrong guesses allowed. Strategic guesses help reduce mistakes and focus on frequent letters.
Pattern Recognition: Players often rely on recognizing patterns in words (e.g., common letter combinations) to make better guesses.
Progressive Difficulty: The game becomes harder as fewer letters are guessed correctly, pushing players to think carefully.
Feedback Loop: Each guess provides feedback (correct or incorrect), which players use to adjust their strategy.
Player Engagement: The tension of limited guesses adds a sense of urgency, engaging players by challenging both their language knowledge and logic.
# key technologies
Backend :

Python/JavaScript (Node.js): For generating random words, if the game pulls from a larger database or handles multiplayer functionality.
APIs: To retrieve word lists or enable multiplayer mode (if applicable).
